Hello! My name is Ramiro Camino and I am from Argentina. I obtained my first degree in Computer Science at the University of Buenos Aires. I worked for several years in the industry of web development, social media games and mobile games. Afterwards, I moved to the research and development area, applying machine learning and natural language processing to different problems like resume parsing, document classification and entity resolution. In 2016, I moved to Luxembourg where I obtained my PhD degree at the University of Luxembourg, implementing machine learning solutions for detecting suspicious activities in banking and blockchain transactions. My research extended to deep generative models with practical applications related to data augmentation and data imputation. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST).
